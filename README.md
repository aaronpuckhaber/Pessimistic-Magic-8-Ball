# Pessimistic-Magic-8-Ball
This is an Android app that was made with Java. The user asks the Magic 8 Ball a question and the Magic 8 Ball will respond when tapped.

When the user taps the 8 ball, a random number is generated. That random number correlates to a predetermined array that contains the responses. 

Unfortunately, all of the responses are pretty negative.
